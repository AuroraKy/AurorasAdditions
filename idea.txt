ok hear me out:

Save & Quit To Map?

[X] - make a button in menu
[X] - save sessions when button and quit map
->[X] Save all sessions (including mods excluding us) to our file
->[X] mark map as "has a save"
->[X] call LevelExit(GiveUp)
->[X] Delete Session data if map is exited/restarted/golden death'd normally
[X] - "continue" if map is saved -> continue like save and quit would?
->[X] Button "Start over" and "continue"
-->[X] continue: start map with session (InArea = true)
-->[X] start over: delete session data, show checkpoints like

[ ] Show data about session?
[ ] Show continue session with checkpoints (or in a seperate menu if no exist) instead of a 3rd thing inbetween

issues:
- It keeps acting like save and quit is happening for no reason

Things to check:
Does it break in Interlude? (prologue/epilogue) no
does it affect save data at all?
(any chance to break save data?)
